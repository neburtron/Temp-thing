# Temp-thing
 

This is a temp thing that I'm doing for the lord game project. it's worth looking at if you found this project randomly somehow.


This is a test for agents running around doing their own stuff

I got a start to it. There's some json formatting started, I moved over the LLM interface and details thing, I got the main chunk of it started in the form of a class, 

### Process

1. look at data + decide what to send over
2. LLM decides next step
3. Evaluation
4. Update Data
